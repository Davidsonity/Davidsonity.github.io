									<p>
										I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering, which has provided me with a strong
										foundation in mathematics and a deep understanding of machine learning concepts. During my
										time as a Data Analyst at Cleanpick Green Nigeria Limited, I worked extensively with data,
                                        extracting valuable insights to support decision-making processes. I have pursued further
										education through programs such as the Udacity Data Analytics Nanodegree, IBM Data Science
										Professional Certificate, IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate, and the AWS AI & ML
										scholarship program.
										<p>
									</p>
										Proficiency in Python programming is one of my key strengths, and I have practical experience
										with popular frameworks like Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, and TensorFlow.
										Additionally, I have expertise in SQL and Google Cloud ML. Currently, I am actively engaged
										as a Freelance Data Scientist at Upwork Inc., where I have successfully completed multiple
										projects, all showcased on my portfolio website.
										<p>
									</p>
										Throughout my career as a Machine Learning Engineer and Data Scientist, I have been involved
										in the design, development, and implementation of various machine learning models to tackle
										diverse problems. I am well-versed in tasks such as forecasting, model evaluation, providing
										recommendations, uncovering patterns, improving data quality, and effectively communicating
										insights to stakeholders. My skill set covers a wide range, including deep learning, recommender
										systems, data analysis, data visualization, and web scraping.
										<p>
									</p>
										To validate my expertise in machine learning, I have obtained certifications such as the Google
										Cloud Machine Learning Professional, IBM Machine Learning Professional, and IBM Data Science
										Professional. These certifications acknowledge my proficiency in a variety of machine learning
										techniques, including unsupervised learning, supervised learning, deep learning, reinforcement
										learning, time series analysis, and survival analysis.
										<p>
									</p>
										Throughout my journey, I have completed numerous impactful projects, including Gender By Voice
										(Clustering), Stranger Things 4 (Sentiment Analysis), Restaurant Ratings Prediction, House Prices
										Prediction, Car Prices Prediction, Netflix Recommender System, Heart Failure Classifier, Nature
										Scene Classifier, and Restaurants Recommender System and much more. Thank you for going through my portfolio
